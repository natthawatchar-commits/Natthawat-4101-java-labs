2.3.1.1 Which version is easier to understand? Why? (Give at least 2 specific reasons) 
    The OOP version is easier to understand.
    1.  The method names in the OOP version are very clear and descriptive, such as searchByID(), 
        determineGrade(), and getName(). When I read the code, I can easily understand what each part is doing 
        without reading the internal details.
    2.  All student-related data and behaviors are grouped together in the Student class. This makes the 
        code easier to follow compared to the procedural version, which uses multiple arrays like ids, names, and 
        scores separately and can be confusing.
    3.  The OOP version does not require complex string parsing to get the grade. The logic is more straightforward 
        and closer to how we think step by step, which makes it easier for beginners to read and understand.

2.3.1.2 Which version would be easier for a new programmer to maintain? Explain your reasoning.
    The OOP version would be easier for a new programmer to maintain.
        In the OOP version, each class and method has a clear responsibility. If we want to change how the grade is 
        calculated, we only need to modify the determineGrade() method in the Student class, without affecting 
        other parts of the program.

2.3.2.1 List all the places you would need to change code in the procedural version
    1.  Score array declaration in main
        Change the student score array to store 4 exam scores instead of 3.
    2.  Sample score data
        Add a 4th exam score for every student in the sample data.
    3.  Average calculation logic
        Ensure the average is calculated using all four exam scores.
    4.  Score display formatting in displayStudent
        Modify System.out.printf(...) to print four exam scores instead of three.
    5.  Score display formatting in searchByID
        Update the formatted output string to include the 4th exam score.
    6.  Method parameters and assumptions
        Review methods that assume a fixed number of exams and update them to work with four scores.

2.3.2.2 List all the places you would need to change code to change in the OOP version
    1.  Exam count constant in Student class
        Change NUM_EXAMS from 3 to 4.
    2.  Exam score array initialization
        The array size automatically updates based on NUM_EXAMS.
    3.  Constructor that accepts exam scores
        Ensure the constructor copies all four exam scores correctly.
    4.  Average calculation method (calculateAverage)
        The method automatically adapts because it uses NUM_EXAMS.
    5.  Grade and pass/fail determination
        No logic change is required, but results now reflect four exams.
    6.  Score display method (displayInfo)
        Update the output format to display the 4th exam score.
    7.  Sample data in GradeManagementSystem.main
        Add the 4th exam score when creating Student objects.
